# Basketball_Stats_Tool
Python Techdegree project 2

In this project we are given a list of teams and list of players with a dictionary of the player's stats.
We need to assign a random group of players to each team equally with six player to each of the three teams. Within each team
there should be an equal number of experience and inexpereince players. Along with assigning players to the teams
we included the players' names, guardians, and the average team height when the team is selected.

A caveat with this program is if there is not a divisible number of teams, players, or players with experience and inxperience in the 
league the program will not operate properly.
